📂 Overview
This repository contains the full implementation of the GA-SFS: A Hybrid Algorithm for Feature Selection in Biomedical Data, including all source code, datasets, and evaluation scripts. The project presents a novel hybrid feature selection approach that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GA) with Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) to enhance classification accuracy, reduce redundancy, and improve interpretability in high-dimensional biomedical datasets. Each dataset folder includes the original dataset (when permitted), preprocessing scripts, and evaluation pipelines used to benchmark our method against several state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Fast SFFS and deep learning-based selectors. The experiments cover six biomedical datasets, both binary and multiclass, with varying levels of imbalance and dimensionality.

The complete study and results have been published in IEEE under the following title:
